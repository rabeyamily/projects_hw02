# Ethical Considerations for Web Scraping from GoodReads

This document outlines the ethical considerations taken into account for the Goodreads Quote Scraper project.

## Respect for Website Resources

1. **Rate Limiting**: The script implements a 5-second delay between requests to avoid overwhelming Goodreads' servers.

2. **Limited Scope**: The script only scrapes 5 pages of quotes to minimize the load on Goodreads' servers.

## Transparency

1. **User-Agent**: The script uses a clear User-Agent string that can be easily identified by Goodreads' servers.

2. **No Misrepresentation**: The script does not attempt to disguise its nature as an automated tool.

## Data Usage and Privacy

1. **Public Data Only**: The script only scrapes publicly available quotes and does not attempt to access any private user data.

2. **Local Storage**: Scraped data is stored locally in a CSV file and is not distributed or shared.

3. **Minimal Data Collection**: Only essential data (quote text, author, and tags) is collected.

## Compliance with Terms of Service

1. **Review of Terms**: Before implementing this scraper, Goodreads' terms of service should be carefully reviewed to ensure compliance.

2. **robots.txt**: The script respects the rules set out in Goodreads' robots.txt file.

## Attribution and Copyright

1. **Proper Attribution**: Users of this script are encouraged to properly attribute quotes to their authors and to Goodreads when using them.

2. **Fair Use**: The collection of quotes is intended for personal use or fair use purposes only.

## Openness to Feedback

## Educational Purpose
